# Complete Approval Workflow Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the approval workflow system where users and admins register with company domains and require approval from company administrators.

## Implementation Summary

### âœ… **1. Domain-Based User Registration**
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/register-with-domain`
- **Purpose**: Allows users to register with a company domain
- **Behavior**: Creates user with `approvalStatus: 'pending'` and creates approval request
- **Approval Required**: Company Admin or Super Admin

### âœ… **2. Domain-Based Admin Registration**
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/register-admin-with-domain`
- **Purpose**: Allows admins to register with a company domain
- **Behavior**: Creates admin with `approvalStatus: 'pending'` and creates approval request
- **Approval Required**: Company Super Admin only

### âœ… **3. Company-Scoped Approval Requests**
- **Implementation**: Admins only see approval requests from their company
- **Security**: Role-based access control ensures data isolation
- **Filtering**: Automatic company filtering in all approval endpoints

### âœ… **4. Enhanced Approval Endpoints**
- **GET /api/approvals/requests**: Get all approval requests (company-scoped)
- **GET /api/approvals/pending**: Get pending approval requests (company-scoped)
- **GET /api/approvals/search**: Search approval requests (company-scoped)
- **POST /api/approvals/requests/{id}/approve**: Approve a request
- **POST /api/approvals/requests/{id}/reject**: Reject a request

## Files Modified

### 1. **Auth Service (`auth.service.ts`)**
- Added `registerUserWithDomain()` method
- Added `registerAdminWithDomain()` method
- Updated `AuthResult` interface to include `approvalRequest`
- Added proper company domain validation

### 2. **Auth Controller (`auth.controller.ts`)**
- Added `registerUserWithDomain()` controller method
- Added `registerAdminWithDomain()` controller method
- Proper error handling and response formatting

### 3. **Auth Routes (`auth.routes.ts`)**
- Added `POST /api/auth/register-with-domain` route
- Added `POST /api/auth/register-admin-with-domain` route
- Added proper schema validation

### 4. **Auth Schemas (`auth.schemas.ts`)**
- Added `registerUserWithDomainSchema`
- Added `registerAdminWithDomainSchema`
- Added proper validation for company domain
- Added work email validation for admin registration

## Complete Test Scenario

### **Step 1: Create Test Company**
```bash
# Create a company with super admin
POST /api/auth/super_admin/register
{
  "companyName": "Test Company Inc",
  "companyDomain": "testcompany.com",
  "industry": "Technology",
  "companySize": "50-100",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@testcompany.com",
  "password": "SuperAdmin123!"
}
```

### **Step 2: Register User with Domain**
```bash
# User registers with company domain
POST /api/auth/register-with-domain
{
  "companyDomain": "testcompany.com",
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "email": "jane.smith@testcompany.com",
  "password": "UserPass123!",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "position": "Developer",
  "department": "Engineering"
}
```

**Expected Result**: User created with `approvalStatus: 'pending'` and approval request created

### **Step 3: Register Admin with Domain**
```bash
# Admin registers with company domain
POST /api/auth/register-admin-with-domain
{
  "companyDomain": "testcompany.com",
  "firstName": "Bob",
  "lastName": "Johnson",
  "email": "bob.johnson@testcompany.com",
  "password": "AdminPass123!",
  "phone": "+1234567891",
  "position": "Team Lead",
  "department": "Engineering"
}
```

**Expected Result**: Admin created with `approvalStatus: 'pending'` and approval request created

### **Step 4: Super Admin Reviews Requests**
```bash
# Super admin logs in
POST /api/auth/super_admin/login
{
  "email": "john.doe@testcompany.com",
  "password": "SuperAdmin123!"
}

# Get all approval requests (company-scoped)
GET /api/approvals/requests
Authorization: Bearer <super_admin_token>

# Get pending requests
GET /api/approvals/pending
Authorization: Bearer <super_admin_token>

# Search requests
GET /api/approvals/search?q=jane
Authorization: Bearer <super_admin_token>
```

**Expected Result**: Only requests from "testcompany.com" are visible

### **Step 5: Approve Requests**
```bash
# Approve user request
POST /api/approvals/requests/{user_request_id}/approve
Authorization: Bearer <super_admin_token>
{
  "notes": "Approved for development team"
}

# Approve admin request
POST /api/approvals/requests/{admin_request_id}/approve
Authorization: Bearer <super_admin_token>
{
  "notes": "Approved as team lead"
}
```

### **Step 6: Verify Login After Approval**
```bash
# User can now login
POST /api/auth/user/login
{
  "email": "jane.smith@testcompany.com",
  "password": "UserPass123!"
}

# Admin can now login
POST /api/auth/admin/login
{
  "email": "bob.johnson@testcompany.com",
  "password": "AdminPass123!"
}
```

## Security Features

### **1. Company Isolation**
- Users can only see approval requests from their company
- Platform admins can see all requests
- Company admins can only see their company's requests

### **2. Role-Based Access**
- **Users**: Can register with domain, cannot approve
- **Admins**: Can approve users, cannot approve admins
- **Super Admins**: Can approve both users and admins
- **Platform Admins**: Can approve all requests

### **3. Token Verification**
- All approval endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- Tokens contain company information for scoping
- Proper authentication middleware on all routes

## Error Handling

### **1. Company Domain Validation**
- Validates company domain exists
- Returns clear error if company not found
- Prevents registration with invalid domains

### **2. Email Validation**
- Regular users: Any email format allowed
- Admins: Must use work email (not personal domains)
- Prevents personal email usage for admin roles

### **3. Database Error Handling**
- Connection errors: User-friendly messages
- Timeout errors: Retry suggestions
- Syntax errors: Support contact information

## Status Codes

|----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `POST /api/auth/register-with-domain` | 201 | 400/404 | User registration with domain |
| `POST /api/auth/register-admin-with-domain` | 201 | 400/404 | Admin registration with domain |
