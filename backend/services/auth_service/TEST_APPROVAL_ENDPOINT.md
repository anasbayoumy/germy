# üß™ Test Approval Endpoint

## üéØ Quick Test Steps

### **Step 1: Test the Approval Endpoint**

Try the approval request again with the debugging enabled:

```bash
POST {{baseUrl}}/api/approvals/requests/0f14ec0e-ab83-4fac-85f9-fb927e5b3778/approve
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "notes": "Testing approval endpoint"
}
```

### **Step 2: Check the Logs**

After making the request, check the auth service logs to see the debugging output:

```bash
docker logs backend-auth-service-1 --tail 50
```

### **Step 3: Expected Debug Output**

You should see logs like:
```
Attempting to approve request: 0f14ec0e-ab83-4fac-85f9-fb927e5b3778 by <approver_id>
Found approval request: {"id":"0f14ec0e-ab83-4fac-85f9-fb927e5b3778","userId":"...","status":"pending",...}
Starting transaction for approval: 0f14ec0e-ab83-4fac-85f9-fb927e5b3778
Updating approval request: 0f14ec0e-ab83-4fac-85f9-fb927e5b3778
Updating user: <user_id> with data: {"approvalStatus":"approved","isVerified":true,"mobileAppAccess":true}
User <user_id> approved by <approver_id>
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **If you still get "Internal server error":**

1. **Check the logs** - Look for any error messages in the debug output
2. **Verify the request ID** - Make sure the approval request exists
3. **Check permissions** - Ensure the approver has the right role
4. **Database connection** - Verify the database is accessible

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"Approval request not found"** - The request ID doesn't exist
2. **"Insufficient permissions"** - The approver doesn't have the right role
3. **"Cannot approve user from different company"** - Company scoping is working correctly
4. **Database errors** - Check if the database is running and accessible

## üìä Expected Results

### **Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User approved successfully"
}
```

### **Error Responses:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Approval request not found"
}
```

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Insufficient permissions to approve users"
}
```

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Cannot approve user from different company"
}
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test the endpoint** with the debugging enabled
2. **Check the logs** for detailed error information
3. **Report the specific error** if it still fails
4. **Verify the database** if there are connection issues

The debugging logs will help us identify exactly where the error is occurring in the approval process.
